Welcome to QuickEase! This is a modern Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with Next.js that allows users to create and manage notes. The goal of QuickEase is to provide a seamless note-taking experience with both online and offline capabilities (offline functionality is still in development and testing).

## Overview

QuickEase is a simple yet powerful note-taking application that leverages Progressive Web App technology to provide an app-like experience directly in the browser. Users can create, view, and delete notes, with data being stored locally.

## Why PWA?

I chose to implement QuickEase as a Progressive Web Application for several compelling reasons:

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: PWAs work on any device with a modern browser
2. **Offline Functionality**: The ability to work without an internet connection (in development and testing)
3. **Installability**: Users can add QuickEase to their home screen
4. **Lightweight and Fast**: PWAs are typically smaller and faster than native applications
5. **Automatic Updates**: Users always have the latest version without manual updates

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices and screen sizes
- **Local Storage**: Notes are saved locally on the device
- **Online/Offline Indicator**: Visual feedback on connection status
- **Simple Interface**: Clean, intuitive design for easy note management
- **Offline Capability**: In development and testing

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **PWA Implementation**: next-pwa package
- **Storage**: Browser's localStorage API
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abaloso/quickease-pwa.git
   cd budget-tracker

2. **Install Dependencies**
    npm install
    or
    yarn install

## Running Locally
    After setting up the environment variables, you can run the development server:
    npm run dev
    or
    yarn dev
    Open [http://localhost:3000] in your browser to see the application.

## Installing on Mobile Devices

One of the key features of a PWA is the ability to install it on your device like a native app. Here's how to install QuickEase on different platforms:

### Installing on Android

1. **Open Chrome**: Launch Chrome browser and visit the QuickEase website.

2. **Open Menu**: Tap the three dots (⋮) in the top-right corner to open the menu.

3. **Tap "Install App" or "Add to Home Screen"**: You'll see an option to install QuickEase in the menu.

4. **Confirm Installation**: Tap "Install" in the dialog that appears.

5. **Access from Home Screen**: QuickEase will now appear on your home screen like any other app.

**Note**: If you don't see the install option, make sure you're using Chrome and have visited the site at least once while online.

### Installing on iPhone/iPad

1. **Open Safari**: QuickEase must be installed from Safari browser on iOS. Other browsers won't work.

2. **Tap the Share Button**: Tap the share icon (square with arrow) at the bottom of the screen.

3. **Find "Add to Home Screen"**: Scroll down in the share menu and tap "Add to Home Screen".

4. **Name Your App**: You can keep the default name or rename it before adding.

5. **Tap "Add"**: The app will be added to your home screen.

**Important**: On iOS, you must use Safari browser. Chrome, Firefox, or other browsers on iOS cannot install PWAs.

## Future Enhancements

- Complete offline functionality implementation
- Note categories and tags
- Rich text formatting
- Cloud synchronization when online
- Search functionality
- Dark mode support
- Export/import notes

## Conclusion

Developing QuickEase as a PWA gave me hands-on experience with a growing web development trend. While I initially planned more complex projects like a crypto prediction app or a mini ChatGPT, time constraints led me to focus on something simpler but fully functional.

This choice let me explore core PWA features—installability and responsive design—without being overwhelmed by complexity. Although offline capabilities are still not working as intended, the project helped me start grasping key PWA concepts and the potential of native-like experiences on the web.

The project deepened my understanding of modern web practices and the promise of PWAs. With more time, I hope to revisit my earlier ideas and build on the foundation QuickEase has given me.
